This file takes fitness, input read, and base pair data from the Domingo et al. (Nature, 2020) paper.  In the data set, we count the number of canonical base pairs (out of 3) as well as the number of Watson-Crick base pairs (2 out of 3) for each sequence.  We then implement a k-means procedure (in the k = 2 and k = 3 cases) to cluster points according to fitness and the counts.  To visualize the data better, points are plotted with a random error decided by a spherical Gaussian.  It is clear the seed choice for k-means impacts the cluster that is chosen for sequences with fewer base pair counts.  With a more refined method, it will be interesting to see if there is a clear signal exhibited by sequences with fewer base pair counts.
